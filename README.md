# GraphQL server using Spring Boot, Part I

Full implementation of the tutorial project from [GraphQL server using Spring Boot, Part I](https://medium.com/supercharges-mobile-product-guide/graphql-server-using-spring-boot-part-i-722bdd715779).

JDK 11 or later is required to compile/run the project.

After cloning or downloading the repo, the application can be run from the command line with the `gradlew bootRun` (Windows) 
or `./gradlew bootRun` (Mac/Linux) command issued from the repo's root folder.

The API can be interacted with using the built-in GraphiQL client (which will be available at http://localhost:8080/graphiql), or any other
GraphQL client.
